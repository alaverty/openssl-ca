OpenSSL Certificate Authority Scripts and Configs

I worked through the tutorial for generating Root CA's, Intermediate CA's and Server certificates on this web site :

https://jamielinux.com/docs/openssl-certificate-authority/create-the-root-pair.html

and captured the steps in bash scripts.

You can run through these scripts in order and it will set up a certificate authority for you.
